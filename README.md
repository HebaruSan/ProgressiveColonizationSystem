       5.  Make the Tier-1+ drill require being at a magic spot to work
       6.  Actually require that a scanner of the appriate tier be in orbit
       7.  Make the scanner require a network of scanner satelites
   2.  Create shinies resource chain

       3.  Create shinies containers that don't let you fill them at the KSP
       4   (complete) Mun/Minmus shinies peak at T1, Duna/Ike/Gilly at T2, T5 only at Dres/Eloo/Moho/Eve
       3.  Make the shinies boost your rep on landing
   3.  Support USI kerbal types
   4.  Life support dialog works nicely in the editors - can estimate usage and ag production
   5.  (complete) Make the GetInfo()'s show the electric utilization
7. Play Nice With Others
   1.  (cut - sticking with the game one) Integrate with Toolbar?
   2.  Integrate with ModuleManager
   3.  Integrate with Community Resource Kit?
   4.  Integrate with Community Categories?
   5.  Integrate with Kerbal Alarm Clock?
   6.  Integrate with the other base parts mod whose name I forget?
   7.  Either reskin the stolen parts or depend on their sources and re-configure them
   8.  Write PDF help

Known Issues:
   1.  If you create a brand new vessel and add a Snack or Fertilizer container to it as the first part, it initially won't
       show any supplies in it.  Clicking "Next Tier" fixes it.  (Looks to me like a bug in KSP - forum thread:
