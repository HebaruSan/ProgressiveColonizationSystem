# Progressive Colonization System

This mod extends Kerbal Space Program with a simple life support mechanism and a production model.  The mod is
different from previous mods along the same vein in that it requires very little math to figure out what
your production rates will be, and it requires incremental exploration.

The best way to get this mod is with CKAN.
