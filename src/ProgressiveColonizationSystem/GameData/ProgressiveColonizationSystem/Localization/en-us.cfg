        #LOC_PKS_Agroponics_Parts_Description = Turns stinkies into snacks!  Some say it does it through complex organic processes!  Some say it's just a whole lot of chili peppers!  Either way there's a limit to how much of this stuff you really want to eat.  As 'Agroponic' research advances to higher tiers, Kerbals can make better and better agroponic snacks.  With all agroponic parts, there's a "Capacity", which is how much it'll actually produce, and the "Quality", which varies by tier and is the maximum percent of a Kerbals' diet that this food can make up.  So, a low-tier part with a "Capacity" of 1 and a "Quality" of 20% would be able to suffice for a crew of 5 - but you'll have to truck up a lot of snacks from Kerbin to make up for the missing 80% of their diet.  Note that Agroponics can only be done in orbit and you can only research up to tier-2 with stations in Kerban orbit.  To get the good stuff, you gotta get out there.  Also, Agroponic food has to be eaten quickly - it's bad to begin with, you don't want to know what happens after you let it sit.
        #LOC_PKS_Agriculture_Parts_Description = Broccoli!  Kerbals love the stuff!  Well, maybe love is too strong a word.  But in any case, Broccolli's a whole lot better tasting than that agroponic slop that Bill keeps trying to call food.  Farming modules have a "Capacity", which is how much food it produces per day (1 unit of capacity could feed one kerbal for a whole day, if the kerbal would actually eat Broccolli exclusively).  It gets better as you tier-up - you know, raw broccolli, grilled broccolli, deep-fried broccolli, and finally beef & broccolli.  Each planetary body presents its own farming challenges, so you have to research it on each planet.  You can't even create a farming module for a world until you recover a probe that's actually landed there.  You can flash-freeze your produce and munch them on your trip home.
        #LOC_PKS_FertilizerFactory_Parts_Description = Makes fertilizer for your Agroponic and Agriculture modules.  Yep, a boring and dirty business best left to a trained Engineer.  This factory has a "Capacity", which is how many units of Agriculture or Agroponic modules it can support.  For each unit of Fertilizer it produces, it consumes one unit of "Stuff", whatever that is.  You need a part that is definitely not a drill to get Stuff.  The output of this part is tiered too - you need Tier2 fertilizer to feed a Tier2 farm (or a Tier0 or Tier1 farm).
        #LOC_PKS_ShiniesFactory_Parts_Description = Okay, so Kerbals have gone to space and discovered that other planets are just giant rocks; not even rock candy.  But hey, that's nothing that the KSP Sales and Marketing team can't fix!  Yeah, what you do is mine up some dirt, put a bit of polish on it, box it up, send it home and sell it as fabulous space-bling!  We'll make millions!  We'll finally be able to install that bowling alley in the Astronaut Complex!
        #LOC_PKS_StuffScrounger_Parts_Description = This is not a drill...  Well, okay, maybe it is a drill.  It gets stuff from the ground that can be turned into fertilizer and shinies.  It has a "Capacity" which is how many units of Fertilizer or Shinies capacity it can support.  At Tier0, you can set this thing to root around your base.  We're gonna assume you had the brains land somewhere good, or maybe just the luck to crash somewhere good.  Whatever.  At higher tiers, you will rely on your scanning network to find the stuff and you'll have to fetch it (or drive your whole base over to it.  Whatever.)
        #LOC_PKS_ScannerHub_Parts_Description = An orbital control hub and data collection site for coordinating resource scanning on a body.  It needs to be located on a station orbiting the body you're scanning for.  It gets more effective at spotting stuff (that is, it's more likely to find something close to your base) if you have more satelites in orbit equipped with resource scanners.  The station needs to have qualified kerbals to run the system as well.  This part is also tiered - so you need a Tier-3 scanning hub in order to spot Tier-3 goodies on the ground.
        #LOC_PKS_Manufacturer = Nermable Nermables, Pty. Ltd.
        #LOC_PKS_SnacksBox_Parts_Description = Think of it as a really big lunchbox.  Well, maybe not big, depending on your budget.  These tanks can be configured to either store the prime grade-A "Snacks" that are produced on Kerbin or whatever Bob manages to hoe out of his greenhouse.  You can also reconfigure these tanks in-flight - but be careful if you do that, as it'll jettison the tanks contents.
        #LOC_PKS_FertilizerBox_Parts_Description = Fertilizer!  Just the stuff to turn stinkies back into shacks.  Some say it's a powerful organic suppliment; some say it's just some really spicy peppers.  These tanks can be configured to either store the prime grade-A "Snacks" that are produced on Kerbin or whatever you manage to prize out of a far-off planet.  You can also reconfigure these tanks in-flight - but be careful if you do that, as it'll jettison the tanks contents.
        #LOC_PKS_ShiniesBox_Parts_Description = What better to haul back all that phat lewt the boys have been making out there in the wider solar system?  Just haul this box out there, fill it up with the product of your labor, bring it back home and rake in the dough baby.
